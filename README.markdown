# roundup - kills shell eating bugs and weeds
You probably want to check out the **[Official roundup Repository](http://github.com/bmizerany/roundup)**

roundup(1) is a unit testing tool for running roundup(5) test plans which are
written in any POSIX shell.  Each test in a plan is run in it's own isolated
sandbox.  A test can pass, be ignored, or fail.  Failed tests output their `set -x trace`.

This fork has many different output formatters:

```shell
$ roundup -f documention
basic tests
  it passes
  it fails
    + false
  it runs before
  it runs after a test passes part 1
  it runs after a test passes part 2
  it runs after if a test fails part 1
    + touch foo.txt
    + test -f foo.txt
    + false
  it runs after if a test fails part 2
  xit ignores this
